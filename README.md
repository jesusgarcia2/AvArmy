This research seeks to detect and analyse vulnerabilities in web services and applications using machine learning techniques. For this, AvArmy software has been developed. This software will rely on the versatility of the Python language due to its great possibilities for data analysis and application of machine learning techniques. AvArmy software is capable of extracting metrics focused on the most common vulnerabilities in web services and applications by performing multiple vulnerability queries, extracting their results and data analysis, and applying machine learning techniques. There is no known software on the market that has the same characteristics. For this purpose, a Dataset has been created focused on the strategic sectors of Spain, taking as a reference a total of 10 strategic sectors of Spain spread over 100 different samples. Finally, the tests have been carried out, which have been satisfactory, thus demonstrating that it is possible to detect and analyse vulnerabilities in web services with artificial intelligence.
